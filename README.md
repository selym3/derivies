# derivies

## todo

* expression parser
* represent implicit equations
* solve for y'
* find roots with newton's method
* plot implicit equations
* optimize creation of expression tree when deriv is called (e.g. `a * 0`, `a * 1`, `a ^ 1`)
* operator overloading between expression for convenience
* add subclass of exp that handles chain rule (requires fixing cyclical imports?)
